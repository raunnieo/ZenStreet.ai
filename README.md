# multi-step forms

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying

page.tsx

. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Collaboration Feature

This project includes a collaborative form filling feature. When a session link is copied and shared, the remote user can also edit the form in real-time. This is achieved using Next.js API routes to simulate real-time collaboration by periodically updating the form state.

### How It Works

1. **Session Initialization**: When a user starts filling out the form, a unique session ID is generated and appended to the URL.
2. **Joining a Session**: When the session link is shared and opened on another device, the remote user joins the same session.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Both users can edit the form, and changes are synchronized in real-time using periodic updates to the form state.

### Key Files

-

FormContext.tsx

: Manages the form state and synchronization logic.

-

route.ts

: Contains the API routes for handling form state updates and session management.
